        <p>Enaefe Aghoghovbia is an aspiring architect and entrepreneur who is driven by utilizing what he's learned in the American education system to develop and enhance his home country of Nigeria. Born in Dallas Texas Enaefe grew up in a multifamily housing unit which exposed him to the brutal and unapologetic world that surrounded him, teaching him to be independent and self-sufficient at an early age. Enaefe as a child sustained his own fair share of childhood trauma however, as he got older he worked towards unwinding society's dictations of where they'd say he'd end up. Using art as a creative outlet he got himself involved in choir, art class, and engineering electives which helped taper his gifts towards a possible career path. In high school he was awarded Best Dressed for his flamboyant style and charming looks, also having an interest in fashion he aspires to gain a footing in the fashion world through architecture. Public figures like Virgil Abloh and Frank Loyd Wright expanded his vision of the architectural discipline as well as inspired him to leave a cultural impact like none other. Mr. Aghoghovbia is currently working on establishing a brand that will not only create unique fashion pieces but also tap into territories like ceramics/glassware, automobiles, luxury tokens, etc innovating each industry. Enaefe attained a supervisory position at American Multimedia Cinemas (AMC) and was also offered a management position all within a year, however he declined due to his passion for pursuing higher education and business. Service for a corporation as big as AMC enlightened him on the systems that were involved in creating a business, with that knowledge he and a collective of friends developed a startup company teaching beginner entrepreneurs the entrepreneurship lifestyle. As of now he is Co-Founder of 1KG a online education/lifestyle platform, also founder of Duphy and EtherealDrip both being custom apparel lines. Mr. Aghoghovbia in the near future plans on getting involved with worldwide corporations that help combat homelessness and other socio political issues, he feels that architecture is a natural occurrence to mankind therefore, what was freely given shouldn't have a price tag. Enaefe Aghoghovbia is driven by his faith in God and his heart for others, those who are in need of basic life essential will find help through his handiwork. Enaefe is motivated to produce results and in doing so he fulfills his primary need to make others feel fulfilled.</p>
